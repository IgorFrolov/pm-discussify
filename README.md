Every commit should be following [Conventional Commits](https://conventionalcommits.org/) guidelines. To avoid mistakes, there's a precommit hook that will validate all commits made to this repository. Please run `$ npm install` in your terminal before committing.

### Design

If you'd like an overview of the project folder structure, have a look at the [Design Workflow](design-workflow.md).

Note that all planning happens under [`project/design/planning`](project/design/planning).

### Codebase

The codebase lives in separate GitHub repositories:

- [`discussify-styleguide`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/discussify-styleguide) - React components shared by the browser-extension, the web app and the iframe/embed.
- [`discussify-browser-extension`](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/discussify-browser-extension) - Discussify's browser extension app

## Roadmap

### POC phase 1:

Key goals:
  - [x] Develop a browser extension.
  - [x] Authentication using uPort until "POC phase 2".
  - [x] Ability to view a discussion happening on the current webpage.
  - [x] Create, remove, edit comments.
  - [x] Reply comments.
  - [x] Release for BETA testing.

### POC phase 2:

Key goals:

- [ ] Ability for users to authenticate themselves using the strategy outlined in [this RFC](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star/pull/15).
    - Effort is underway to develop this, under [IDM](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/pm-idm).
- [ ] Verify ownership of the comments via signatures, also detailed in the RFC.
    - Discussions [here](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/peer-star-app/issues/4#issuecomment-411109427).
- [ ] Ability to verify user's identities, including their claims & proofs.
- [ ] Ability to view comment history such as edits and removals.

### MVP

Key goals:

- [ ] Ability to view discussions I have participated in the past, including receiving notifications about new activity on any of them.
- [ ] Guarantee the persistency of the data by integrating the pinner.

### v1.0.0

Key goals:

- [ ] Ability to discuss on specific parts of the page, using [Web Annotations](https://www.w3.org/annotation/).
- [ ] Ability to have private discussions, with support for inviting and kicking users.
    - [Several discussions around ACL and capabilities](https://github.com/ipfs/dynamic-data-and-capabilities/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+acl).
- [ ] Ability to subscribe/mute discussions.
- [ ] Ability to invite other people to a public discussion, even if the invitee does not have Discussify installed. This would potentially mean creating a protocol for inviting for a generic collaboration, through IDM, which would require installing an additional app.
- [ ] Ensure that it's performant, stable and not resource hungry.
- [ ] Define (and execute) a plan for the launch of Discussify as a decentralized product.
