# SWOT Analysis

**Strengths and Weaknesses:** Internal factors, like financial or human resources, equipment or systems, culture, reputation, and how they relate to the goal. If that specific factor is a strength or a weakness depends on the goal. Essentially look for what constitutes an advantage or a disadvantage for achieving the goals.

**Opportunities and Threats:** External factors, like outside funding, suppliers, market, political and environmental trends. These factors are typically outside your control, and anticipating them can be good to optimise opportunities and handle threats. Map the opportunities and threats to the internal strengths and weaknesses in order to assess whether you need to make adjustments to your strategy.

## Objectives

- Create PoC for a decentralised discussable web.
- Have a presentable demo in time for Decentralised Web Summit.
- Open data format, so that others can build on top, or replacement apps.

## Analysis

### Strengths

- Decentralised.
- P2P.
- Cost effective, does not require backend infrastructure.
- Uses IPFS.
- Uses open standards or technologies that eventually become standards.

### Weaknesses

- Resource demanding on peer device, such as storage and memory.
- Fragile trust model, requiring additional security layer run on each peer.
- Account creation/authentication friction.
- Less efficient data model.
- Fragile persistence.
- State bootstrap (federated & untrustworthy p2p state fetch)

### Opportunities

TODO

### Threats

TODO

- Competitors?
- Blockstack potentially not compatible with Chrome extensions, e.g.: authentication flow
