# Audience

Work needs to be done here, at the moment we're focusing on:

- Decentralised web aficionados
- Blockchain aficionados

There might be focus groups we can explore here, further segmenting, we should define specifically:

- Demographics: age, gender, geographic location.
- Psychographics: values, tastes, hobbies.

This becomes particularly important for the go to market approach, but it also can have a considerable impact on the brand development we're already doing.

For the current purpose, we have limited time, so let's simplify this, and focus on staying true to the core values, and later we revisit this.
